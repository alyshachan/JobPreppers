Job Preppers is a platform for job seekers and recruiters to connect. The application is divided into two main parts: the frontend and the backend.

### Please visit https://jobpreppers.co for the deployed version! :)
If the website is down, please email anyone on the Job Preppers team and we can turn it back on.
